# Star-Wars-Trench-Run
A University assignment which uses Unity and C# scripts

This game was created to train my skills in both Unity/scripting and mobile game development
which uses touch controls. This game shows the progression in how my coding skill has developed since
past projects and showed me new techniques to improve my coding standard.
